/*
 * GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C++ library
 * designed to help developers to model and implement optimization problem
 * solving. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of
 * combinatorial and optimization real-time problems represented by a CSP/COP/CFN.
 *
 * GHOST has been first developped to help making AI for the RTS game
 * StarCraft: Brood war, but can be used for any kind of applications where
 * solving combinatorial and optimization problems within some tenth of
 * milliseconds is needed. It is a generalization of the Wall-in project.
 * Please visit https://github.com/richoux/GHOST for further information.
